# VeinFinder Tool pitch

Every ringa knows that a good spot to mine is an integral part of a successful career, but looking for one could take ages...

*Well, no more!*

Ringa Communications, Ltd. presents:

VeinFindr(TM) - a handy tool for composition analysis of the rings.

- Looking for a specific mineral to mine?
- Trying to find a dense area ful of Beryllium to make huge profits?
- Want to understand the composition of the rings better?

Use VeinFindr(TM)! 

### WARNING! Consider this before usage:
Looking for sweet spots to mine is a good part of the gameplay! It is semi-random and nothing beats the feeling of finally locating one. This tool provides a way to decrease the effort and time taken for this, which MIGHT KILL THE FUN!

I am considering adding a balanced version of this tool by incorporating it as a mod in-game.(somehow). All suggestions and requests are welcome!

How it works:
- choose a location on the map using sliders
- press SCN button to conduct a scan
- the tool will analyze an area of 30x30 km around the center and display the result in a nice graph
- the result is somewhat imprecise, so multiple scans are advised
- use the visual data to find this spot on the dive screen
- make PROFIT!

---
Current features:
- A neat, simple retro interface consisting of:
	- A big overview screen
	- A smaller window with a zoomed in view
	- Four sliders (2 for each axis) for precise control of the scanner
	- A graphial representation of the readout

---
Planned features:

- A better interface
- A better description
- Ability to create bookmarks
- Ability to run a continious scan to better display the composition
- Ability to tune zoom of the small window

This is a learnning project and a WIP, so all and every bit of opinion/suggestion/advice is welcome!
